The asBirthRule files define a particle effect. A particle effect is an
effect where many, small objects are spewed out from a point at certain
occasions. For weather effects, the particles can be rain drops, for
colliding with a parking meter, the particles may be coins.

The format is ASCII-based and consist of a block enclosed by *{* and
*}*.

The files start with a definition of the type of banger data given. None
of the MM2 files use anything but type *a*, like this:

`type: a`

Next comes the main asBirthRule block:

`asBirthRule {`
`...`
`}`

This block can contain several tag-value parameters:

Tags of the asBirthRule block

Some of the global particle effects use the texture image named "TODO: I
could have sworn that I saw an image where the indices matched all of
the default vehicular particle effect, now I can't find it". This image,
and all particle texture images, are divided into rectangular frames
used for animation. All frames are equal in size and they are numbered
for easy access in the asBirthRule. Animation sequences must be made up
of consequtive frames in the image, but the image may contain other
frames for different particle effects.

Oject collision particle effects may use other images, see *TexNumber*
in [dgBangerData](dgBangerData "wikilink"), but these are structured in
the same way, with frames and indices to the frames.

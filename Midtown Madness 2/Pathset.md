Props can be placed using three different methods. The type of path is
defined by the type parameter. Values are as follows:

  - 0 - Single Points
  - 1 - Directed Points
  - 2 - Line strip

0 (Single Points) - it's a list of object positions, one point = one
position, you cannot control object direction. Spacing seems to be
ignored. Example: treepalm in SF (index: 6 on the props list).

1 (Directed Points) - the point list is a sequence of point pairs. The
first point is the position of the prop and the second defines the
direction of one of the local coordinate axis. Object can ONLY be
rotated around Y-axis and the angle is determined by vector between two
points. Spacing seems to be ignored. Example: sp_transbayexit_f in SF
(index: 46 on the props list)

2 (Line Strip) - the sequence is no longer a list of pairs. Instead the
points 0 and 1 defines the first line segment, just as in the previous
type, but the next line segment is defined by point 1 and 2, the next by
point 2 and 3 and so on. Each line segment is filled with props, spaced
by the spacing parameter. Example: sp_tree1_s in SF (index: 10 on the
props list)
